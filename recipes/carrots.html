    <h1>Carrots.</h1>
If you folowed my instant pot pot roast recipe than you will have leftover carrots. This is because I listed them in the ingredients and then didn't tell you what to do with them. They should have gone in with the Roast, but now they are getting dry out on your counter. So I will help you turn these dry boring leftover carrots into something you can serve and eat at any time.
